<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with the QR Code Generator & Reader:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Clone the repository</strong>:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/AndreasLampos/QRCodeGenerator.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Navigate to the project directory</strong>:
        <pre><code>cd qrcodegen</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Add the ZXing libraries</strong> to your classpath (download the latest version from <a href="https://github.com/zxing/zxing/releases">ZXing releases</a>).
